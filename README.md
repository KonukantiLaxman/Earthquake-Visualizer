✨ Features:

📡 Live Data — Fetches latest earthquake data (past day, week, or month).

🌐 Interactive Map — Built with Leaflet.js

🔴 Markers with Severity — Color and size represent magnitude.

🎚 Magnitude Filter — Slider to show only quakes above chosen strength.

⏳ Time Range Selector — Switch between past 24 hours, 7 days, or 30 days.

📜 Sidebar List — Earthquake details (location, magnitude, time, depth).
